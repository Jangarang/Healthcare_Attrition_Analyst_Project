# Healthcare Mental Health & Attrition Data Processing

This project is a work in progress.

## Summary

This project processes CSV files related to healthcare, mental health, and employee attrition. It combines data from two separate CSV sources to uncover potential relationships and merges them into a single dataset. 
From there, it uses raw SQL queries to automatically generate database tables and define their relationships for easier data analysis and visualization.
